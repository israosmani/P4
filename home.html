    <div class="card-body">Geography</div>
    <p class="card-text">Bangladesh is a South Asian country situated at the northeastern end of the Indian subcontinent. It shares borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar (Burma) to the southeast, while the Bay of Bengal lies to the south. The country's geography is primarily characterized by its low-lying alluvial plains, crisscrossed by numerous rivers, including the Ganges (locally known as the Padma), Brahmaputra, and Meghna. These rivers form the fertile Bengal Delta, one of the largest in the world, making Bangladesh prone to both floods and cyclones. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world, lies in the southwest region, serving as a critical ecological hotspot and home to the iconic Bengal tiger. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, sits in the central part of the country, acting as its economic and cultural hub. Overall, Bangladesh's geography heavily influences its agriculture-dependent economy, cultural heritage, and vulnerability to natural disasters.

    <div class="card-body">Culture and Religion</div>
    <p class="card-text">Bangladesh's cultural tapestry is woven with diverse traditions that reflect its rich history and influences. At the heart of Bangladeshi culture is its language, Bengali, which not only serves as a means of communication but also embodies the nation's identity and heritage. Religion, particularly Islam, plays a significant role, shaping many customs and practices. Festivals like Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adha, and Pohela Boishakh bring communities together in celebration, showcasing the country's cultural vibrancy. Music and dance, including traditional forms like Baul and Bhatiali, provide a rhythmic backdrop to daily life. Cuisine is a culinary journey, with flavors ranging from aromatic biryani to savory hilsa fish curry. Traditional attire, hospitality, and the intricacies of weddings all reflect the warmth and hospitality deeply ingrained in Bangladeshi society. Arts and crafts, from pottery to nakshi kantha, offer glimpses into the country's artisanal heritage. Family bonds and community spirit are cherished, fostering a sense of belonging and solidarity. Together, these cultural and traditional customs form the colorful mosaic of Bangladesh's identity, enriching the lives of its people and captivating the imagination of the world.

    <div class="card-body">History</div>
    <p class="card-text">Bangladesh's history is a tale of struggle, resilience, and independence. Formerly East Pakistan, it gained independence in 1971 after a tumultuous nine-month war of liberation against West Pakistan, fueled by linguistic, cultural, and economic disparities. The roots of Bangladesh's distinct identity trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, which created East and West Pakistan as two geographically separated regions with a shared religion but divergent cultures and languages. The quest for autonomy intensified over the years, culminating in the 1971 Liberation War, during which millions sacrificed their lives for the dream of a free and sovereign nation. Since independence, Bangladesh has faced numerous challenges, including political instability, natural disasters, and socio-economic issues. However, it has also made significant strides in areas such as development, education, and women's empowerment, carving out a unique place on the global stage as a resilient and dynamic nation.

  <div class="card bg-info text-white">
    <div class="card-body">Demographics</div>
    <p class="card-text"> Bangladesh is located in South Asia, is the eighth-most populous country in the world. With a population exceeding 160 million people, it's one of the most densely populated countries globally. The demographic landscape is predominantly young, with a median age of around 27 years. Bengali is the official language, spoken by the vast majority of the population. Islam is the predominant religion, with over 90% of Bangladeshis identifying as Muslims. The population is largely rural, with agriculture being a significant part of the economy. However, urbanization is increasing rapidly, particularly in major cities like Dhaka and Chittagong. Despite progress in areas such as healthcare and education, poverty remains a significant challenge for a substantial portion of the population.</p>
